## Honesty Policy <time class='estimate'>&lt;1 hour</time>

> "Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving."
> -James E. Faust

I cannot stress enough the importance of honesty and open communication. If I am to help you on this journey to becoming a developer you must be honest with me about where you are, what you are struggling on, what you are (un)comfortable on, and where I can help. It is just as important to tell me when I am _not_ helping as when you need help.

* __Be honest with your feedback.__
* __Be honest with your homework.__
* __Be honest with your understanding.__
* __Be honest with your feelings.__
* __Be honest with your peers.__
* __Be honest with yourself.__

For the sake of Clarity, we'll define "Honesty" as:

> sincere, blameless, fairly earned, simple, unpretentious, free of deceit
