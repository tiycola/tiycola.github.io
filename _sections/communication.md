## Communication Policy <time class='estimate'>1-2 hours</time>

This policy is intended to ensure you are successful in this program. **In all cases, more communication is better.** The guidelines below are meant to help structure our communication for the best results.

**Please mark this section complete with the button above** once you have read it and are comfortable with it.

We will be using a program called [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads) for the majority of our online conversations. This is vastly preferred over email for a variety of reasons. In addition to being an instant messaging application, it can also handle group chat, has numerous integrations with other services, and is easily searchable. You can [read more about how to use Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/202622877-Slack-Guides) on their website.

### Class Participation

There will be many times during class when I will ask for participation. This may come in the form of an answer to a question, a request for questions, a volunteer to show their solution to a problem, or many other ways. **Your participation can only help you succeed.** You can read more about how to frame your mind for success in the [Mindset]({{site.baseurl}}/sections/mindset.html) section, but I highly encourage you to push past any mental barriers and welcome this new environment, however uncomfortable it might make you! _We are all here to help you succeed._

### Asking Questions

You should _**always**_ feel comfortable asking your instructor questions. Asking questions is vital to your success in this course, and well-formed questions are the best route to finding answers. So what is a well-formed question? Let's look at some examples:

#### Poorly-Formed Questions:  

> * I don't understand your lecture code.
> * Why doesn't any of my code work?
> * How do I start the homework?

#### Well-Formed Versions of the Questions Above:

> * In lecture you used the `append()` function here [show code]. I would expect it to do X, I don't understand why it did Y. Can you explain that?
> * I expected this code [show code] to do X, it actually does Y. Can you help me understand why, and what I need to change to produce X?
> * I'm having trouble starting the homework. I want to start by implementing X, and I know I need some HTML, but I'm not sure what tags to use.

### Tips for Success

* Asking for help is always encouraged.
* More communication is better than less.
* A peer is better than a google search.
* A google search is better than staring into the abyss(†).
* Stargazing is better than giving up.
* "I don't understand" is a valid question to ask.
* Sharing is good, but always include a source. Do not spread misinformation.
* Be open and [honest](honesty.html) when you are struggling, feeling behind, or overwhelmed.
