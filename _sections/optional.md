## Optional Material

The following exercises are not required! However, if you have more time you'd like to spend before class, here are some further resources.

### Typing

Believe it or not, *a lot* of time in the first weeks of programming is spent fixing simple typing errors.If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try [Keybr](http://www.keybr.com/)). If you already know how to touch type, I would still recommend working through the Ruby on Rails lessons on [Typing.io](http://typing.io). Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.
